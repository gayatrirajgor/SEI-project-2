# Final Space ðŸ‘¾ - Front-End React Project
For my second project on the Software Engineering Immersive at General Assembly, I was assigned a 48-hour paired hackathon to design a React application that uses a public API.

This was deployed via Netlify and can be accessed [here](https://final-space-project.netlify.app/).

## Brief ðŸ“ƒ
* Consume a public API
* The app should contain several components and include a router with several 'pages'.
* Be deployed online 

## Technologies ðŸ’»
* React.js & React Router
* HTML5
* CSS3
* Bulma 
* FontAwesome 
* Git & HitHub
* Insomnia 
* Axios
* Animate CSS 
* [Final Space API](https://finalspaceapi.com/)

## Approach 
We first researched a number of APIs and decided to showcase data based on the TV show, Final Space.

### Routes
The routes to the various pages were built with React as well as BrowserRouter, Switch and Route from React-Router-DOM.

```js
      <BrowserRouter>
        <Navbar />
        <Switch>
          <Route exact path="/" component={Home} />
          <Route exact path="/characters" component={CharacterIndex}/>
          <Route exact path="/characters/:id" component={CharacterDetail}/>
          <Route exact path="/episodes" component={EpisodeIndex}/>
          <Route exact path="/episodes/:id" component={EpisodeDetail}/>
        </Switch>
      </BrowserRouter>
```

## Components 
### Homepage
The homepage included a hero image along with two buttons. The first button sends the user to all of the show's characters, while the second button brings the user to all of the show's episodes.

### All Characters 
To display all of the show's characters, we used an axios request from the API within a `useEffect` and modified the hook's state. We then used a map function on the array of characters to display them on the website, and they were styled as cards with Bulma.

```js
useEffect(()=> {
    const getData = async() => {
      try {
        const { data } = await axios.get('https://finalspaceapi.com/api/v0/character/')
        setCharacterArray(data)
      } catch (error) {
        console.log(error)
      }
    }
    getData()
  },[])
```
### Search
We gave the user the ability to search for characters by adding a search option. To do this, we utilised a `useEffect` to search through the characters array and return the character that matched what the user typed into the search field.

```javascript
useEffect(() => {
    const filteredCharac = () => {
      const regexSearch = new RegExp(search, 'i') 
      const filtered = characterArray.filter(character => {
        return regexSearch.test(character.name)
      })
      setFiltered(filtered)
    } 
    filteredCharac()
  }, [search])
```
